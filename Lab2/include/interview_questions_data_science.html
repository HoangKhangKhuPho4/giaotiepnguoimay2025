        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>
          Data science is an interdisciplinary field that mines raw data,
          analyzes it, and comes up with patterns that are used to extract
          valuable insights from it. Statistics, computer science, machine
          learning, deep learning, data analysis, data visualization, and
          various other technologies form the core foundation of data science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, data science has gained widespread importance due to
          the importance of data. Data is considered as the new oil of the
          future which when analyzed and harnessed properly can prove to be very
          beneficial to the stakeholders. Not just that, a data scientist gets
          the exposure to work in diverse domains, solving real-life practical
          problems all by making use of trendy technologies. The most common
          real-time application is fast delivery of food in apps such as Uber
          Eats by aiding the delivery person shows the fastest possible route to
          reach the destination from the restaurant. Data Science is also used
          in recommendation systems in e-commerce sites like Amazon, Flipkart,
          etc. which recommends the user what item they can buy based on their
          search history. Not just in recommendation systems, Data Science is
          becoming increasingly popular in fraud detection applications to
          detect any fraud involved in credit-based financial applications. A
          successful data scientist can interpret data, perform innovation and
          bring out creativity while solving problems that help drive business
          and strategic goals. This makes this the most lucrative job of the
          21st century.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Science Interview Questions for Freshers</h3>
        <h4>1. What does one understand by the term Data Science?</h4>
        <p>
          An interdisciplinary field that constitutes various scientific
          processes, algorithms, tools, and machine learning techniques working
          to help find common patterns and gather sensible insights from the
          given raw input data using statistical and mathematical analysis is
          called Data Science.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It starts with gathering the business requirements and relevant
            data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the data is acquired, it is maintained by performing data
            cleaning, data warehousing, data staging, and data architecture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data processing then takes the role of exploring the data, mining
            it, analyzing it which can help result to get generate the summary
            of the insights extracted from the data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the exploratory stages are completed, the data scientist is
            subjected to various algorithms like predictive analysis,
            regression, text mining, recognition patterns, etc depending on the
            requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the final stage, the results are communicated to the business in
            a visually appealing manner. This is where the skill of data
            visualization, reporting, and different business intelligence tools
            come into the picture.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          2. What is the difference between data analytics and data science?
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Data science involves the task of transforming data by using various
            scientific methods and tools to extract meaningful insights using
            which a data scientist can help in making business scenarios.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data analytics deals with checking the existing hypothesis and
            information and answers questions for a better and effective
            business-related decision-making process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data Science drives innovation by answering questions that build new
            questions and avenues for futuristic problems. Data analytics
            focuses on getting present meaning from existing historical context
            whereas data science focuses on predicting the future outcome with
            the past analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data Science can be considered as a broad subject that makes use of
            various mathematical and scientific tools and algorithms for solving
            complex problems whereas data analytics can be considered as a
            specific field dealing with specific concentrated problems using
            fewer tools of statistics and visualization.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>3. What does it mean when the p-values are high and low?</h4>
        <p>
          A p-value is the measure of the probability of having results equal to
          or more than the results achieved under a specific hypothesis assuming
          that the null hypothesis is correct. This represents the probability
          that our observed difference occurred randomly by chance.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Low p-value which means values &lt; 0.05 means that the null
            hypothesis can be rejected and the data is unlikely with null true.
          </li>
          <li>
            High p-value i.e values &gt; 0.05 indicates the strength in favor of
            the null hypothesis. It means that the data is like with the null
            true.
          </li>
          <li>p-value = 0.05 means that the hypothesis can go either way.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>4. When is resampling done?</h4>
        <p>
          Resampling is a methodology used to sample data for improving accuracy
          and quantify the uncertainty of population parameters. It is done to
          ensure the model is good enough by training the model in different
          patterns of data to ensure variations are handled. It is also done in
          the cases where models need to be validated using random subsets or
          when substituting labels on data while performing tests.
        </p>
        <h4>5. What do you understand by Imbalanced Data?</h4>
        <p>
          Data is said to be highly imbalanced if it is distributed unequally
          across different categories. These datasets result in an error in
          model performance and result in inaccuracy.
        </p>
        <h4>
          6. Are there any differences between the expected value and mean
          value?
        </h4>
        <p>
          There are not many differences between these two, but it is to be
          noted that these are used in different contexts. The mean value
          generally refers to the probability distribution whereas the expected
          value is referred to in the contexts involving random variables.
        </p>
        <h4>7. What do you understand by Survivorship Bias?</h4>
        <p>
          This bias refers to the logical error while focusing on aspects that
          survived some process and overlooking those that did not work due to
          lack of prominence. This bias can lead to deriving wrong conclusions.
        </p>
        <h4>
          8. Define the terms KPI, lift, model fitting, robustness and DOE.
        </h4>
        <p>
          KPI: KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator that measures how well
          the business achieves its objectives.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Lift: This is a performance measure of the target model measured
            against a random choice model. Lift indicates how good the model is
            at prediction versus if there was no model.
          </li>
          <li>
            Model Fitting: This indicates how well the model under consideration
            fits given observations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Robustness: This represents the system's capability to handle
            differences and variances effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            DOE: stands for the design of experiments, which represents the task
            design aiming to describe and explain information variation under
            hypothesized conditions to reflect variables.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>9. Define confounding variables.</h4>
        <p>
          Confounding variables are also known as confounders. These variables
          are a type of extraneous variables that influence both independent and
          dependent variables causing spurious association and mathematical
          relationships between those variables that are associated but are not
          causally related to each other.
        </p>
        <h4>10. Define and explain selection bias?</h4>
        <p>
          The selection bias occurs in the case when the researcher has to make
          a decision on which participant to study. The selection bias is
          associated with those researchers when the selected sample is not
          random. The selection bias is also called the selection effect. The
          selection bias is caused by as a result of the method of sample
          collection.
        </p>
        <p>Four types of selection bias are explained below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sampling Bias: As a result of a population that is not random at
            all, some members of a population have fewer chances of getting
            included than others, resulting in a biased sample. This causes a
            systematic error known as sampling bias.
          </li>
          <li>
            Time Interval: Trials may be stopped early if we reach any extreme
            value but if all variables are similar invariance, the variables
            with the highest variance have a higher chance of achieving the
            extreme value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data: It is when specific data is selected arbitrarily and the
            generally agreed criteria are not followed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attrition: Attrition in this context means the loss of the
            participants. It is the discounting of those subjects that did not
            complete the trial.
          </li>

            As a statistician I can understand whatever differences you try to
            tell in below question you are actually telling same thing. "The
            mean value generally refers to the probability distribution whereas
            the expected value is referred to in the contexts involving random
            variables." Random variable term only associate with probability
            distribution. (only random variables have the probability
            distribution).
